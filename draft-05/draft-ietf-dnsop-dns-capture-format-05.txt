                   C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format
                 draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format-05

Abstract

   This document describes a data representation for collections of DNS
   messages.  The format is designed for efficient storage and
   transmission of large packet captures of DNS traffic; it attempts to
   minimize the size of such packet capture files but retain the full
   DNS message contents along with the most useful transport metadata.
   It is intended to assist with the development of DNS traffic
   monitoring applications.

1.  Introduction

   There has long been a need to collect DNS queries and responses on
   authoritative and recursive name servers for monitoring and analysis.
   This data is used in a number of ways including traffic monitoring,
   analyzing network attacks and "day in the life" (DITL) [ditl]
   analysis.

   A wide variety of tools already exist that facilitate the collection
   of DNS traffic data, such as DSC [dsc], packetq [packetq], dnscap
   [dnscap] and dnstap [dnstap].  However, there is no standard exchange
   format for large DNS packet captures.  The PCAP [pcap] or PCAP-NG
   [pcapng] formats are typically used in practice for packet captures,
   but these file formats can contain a great deal of additional
   information that is not directly pertinent to DNS traffic analysis
   and thus unnecessarily increases the capture file size.

   There has also been work on using text based formats to describe DNS
   packets such as [I-D.daley-dnsxml], [I-D.hoffman-dns-in-json], but
   these are largely aimed at producing convenient representations of
   single messages.

   Many DNS operators may receive hundreds of thousands of queries per
   second on single name server instance so a mechanism to minimize the
   storage size (and therefore upload overhead) of the data collected is
   highly desirable.

   The format described in this document, C-DNS (Compacted-DNS),
   focusses on the problem of capturing and storing large packet capture
   files of DNS traffic. with the following goals in mind:

   o  Minimize the file size for storage and transmission

   o  Minimizing the overhead of producing the packet capture file and
      the cost of any further (general purpose) compression of the file

   This document contains:

   o  A discussion of the some common use cases in which such DNS data
      is collected Section 3

   o  A discussion of the major design considerations in developing an
      efficient data representation for collections of DNS messages

   o  A description of why CBOR [RFC7049] was chosen for this format
      Section 5

      messages Section 7.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "Packet" refers to individual IPv4 or IPv6 packets.  Typically these
   are UDP, but may be constructed from a TCP packet.  "Message", unless
   otherwise qualified, refers to a DNS payload extracted from a UDP or
   TCP data stream.

   The parts of DNS messages are named as they are in [RFC1035].  In
   specific, the DNS message has five sections: Header, Question,
   Answer, Authority, and Additional.

   Pairs of DNS messages are called a Query and a Response.

3.  Data Collection Use Cases

   In an ideal world, it would be optimal to collect full packet
   captures of all packets going in or out of a name server.  However,
   there are several design choices or other limitations that are common
   to many DNS installations and operators.

   o  DNS servers are hosted in a variety of situations

      *  Self-hosted servers

      *  Third party hosting (including multiple third parties)

      *  Third party hardware (including multiple third parties)

   o  Data is collected under different conditions

      *  On well-provisioned servers running in a steady state

      *  On heavily loaded servers

      *  On virtualized servers

      *  On servers that are under DoS attack

      *  On servers that are unwitting intermediaries in DoS attacks

   o  Traffic can be collected via a variety of mechanisms

      *  On the same hardware as the name server itself

      *  Using a network tap on an adjacent host to listen to DNS
         traffic

      *  Using port mirroring to listen from another host

   o  The capabilities of data collection (and upload) networks vary

      *  Out-of-band networks with the same capacity as the in-band
         network

      *  Out-of-band networks with less capacity than the in-band
         network

      *  Everything being on the in-band network

   Thus, there is a wide range of use cases from very limited data
   collection environments (third party hardware, servers that are under
   attack, packet capture on the name server itself and no out-of-band
   network) to "limitless" environments (self hosted, well provisioned
   servers, using a network tap or port mirroring with an out-of-band
   networks with the same capacity as the in-band network).  In the
   former, it is infeasible to reliably collect full packet captures,
   especially if the server is under attack.  In the latter case,
   collection of full packet captures may be reasonable.

   As a result of these restrictions, the C-DNS data format was designed
   with the most limited use case in mind such that:

   o  data collection will occur on the same hardware as the name server
      itself

   o  collected data will be stored on the same hardware as the name
      server itself, at least temporarily

   o  collected data being returned to some central analysis system will
      use the same network interface as the DNS queries and responses

   o  there can be multiple third party servers involved

   Because of these considerations, a major factor in the design of the
   format is minimal storage size of the capture files.

   Another significant consideration for any application that records
   DNS traffic is that the running of the name server software and the
   transmission of DNS queries and responses are the most important jobs
   of a name server; capturing data is not.  Any data collection system
   co-located with the name server needs to be intelligent enough to
   carefully manage its CPU, disk, memory and network utilization.  This
   leads to designing a format that requires a relatively low overhead
   to produce and minimizes the requirement for further potentially
   costly compression.

   However, it was also essential that interoperability with less
   restricted infrastructure was maintained.  In particular, it is
   highly desirable that the collection format should facilitate the re-

   creation of common formats (such as PCAP) that are as close to the
   original as is realistic given the restrictions above.

4.  Design Considerations

   This section presents some of the major design considerations used in
   the development of the C-DNS format.

   1.  The basic unit of data is a combined DNS Query and the associated
       Response (a "Q/R data item").  The same structure will be used
       for unmatched Queries and Responses.  Queries without Responses
       will be captured omitting the response data.  Responses without
       queries will be captured omitting the Query data (but using the
       Question section from the response, if present, as an identifying
       QNAME).

       *  Rationale: A Query and Response represents the basic level of
          a clients interaction with the server.  Also, combining the
          Query and Response into one item often reduces storage
          requirements due to commonality in the data of the two
          messages.

   2.  All fields in each Q/R data item will be optional.

       *  Rationale: Different users will have different requirements
          for data to be available for analysis.  Users with minimal
          requirements should not have to pay the cost of recording full
          data, however this will limit the ability to perform certain
          kinds of data analysis and also reconstruct packet captures.
          For example, omitting the resource records from a Response
          will reduce C-DNS file size, and in principle responses can be
          synthesized if there is enough context.

   3.  Multiple data items will be collected into blocks in the format.
       Common data in a block will be abstracted and referenced from
       individual data items by indexing.  The maximum number of data
       items in a block will be configurable.

       *  Rationale: This blocking and indexing provides a significant
          reduction in the volume of file data generated.  Although this
          introduces complexity, it provides compression of the data
          that makes use of knowledge of the DNS message structure.

       *  It is anticipated that the files produced can be subject to
          further compression using general purpose compression tools.
          Measurements show that blocking significantly reduces the CPU
          required to perform such strong compression.  See
          Appendix C.2.

       *  [TODO: Further discussion of commonality between DNS messages
          e.g. common query signatures, a finite set of valid responses
          from authoritatives]

   4.  Traffic metadata can optionally be included in each block.
       Specifically, counts of some types of non-DNS packets (e.g.
       ICMP, TCP resets) sent to the server may be of interest.

   5.  The wire format content of malformed DNS messages can optionally
       be recorded.

       *  Rationale: Any structured capture format that does not capture
          the DNS payload byte for byte will be limited to some extent
          in that it cannot represent "malformed" DNS messages (see
          Section 8).  Only those messages that can be fully parsed and
          transformed into the structured format can be fully
          represented.  Therefore it can greatly aid downstream analysis
          to have the wire format of the malformed DNS messages
          available directly in the C-DNS file.  Note, however, this can
          result in rather misleading statistics.  For example, a
          malformed query which cannot be represented in the C-DNS
          format will lead to the (well formed) DNS responses with error
          code FORMERR appearing as 'unmatched'.

5.  Choice of CBOR

   This document presents a detailed format description using CBOR, the
   Concise Binary Object Representation defined in [RFC7049].

   The choice of CBOR was made taking a number of factors into account.

   o  CBOR is a binary representation, and thus is economical in storage
      space.

   o  Other binary representations were investigated, and whilst all had
      attractive features, none had a significant advantage over CBOR.
      See Appendix C for some discussion of this.

   o  CBOR is an IETF standard and familiar to IETF participants.  It is
      based on the now-common ideas of lists and objects, and thus
      requires very little familiarization for those in the wider
      industry.

   o  CBOR is a simple format, and can easily be implemented from
      scratch if necessary.  More complex formats require library
      support which may present problems on unusual platforms.

   o  CBOR can also be easily converted to text formats such as JSON
      ([RFC7159]) for debugging and other human inspection requirements.

   o  CBOR data schemas can be described using CDDL
      [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl].

6.  C-DNS format overview

6.1.  Conceptual Overview

   The following figures show purely schematic representations of the
   C-DNS format to convey the high-level structure of the C-DNS format.
   Section 7 provides a detailed discussion of the CBOR representation
   and individual elements.

   Figure showing the C-DNS format (PNG) [1]

   Figure showing the C-DNS format (SVG) [2]

   Figure showing the Q/R data item and Block tables format (PNG) [3]

   Figure showing the Q/R data item and Block tables format (SVG) [4]

   A C-DNS file begins with a file header containing a file-type-id
   identifier and a file-preamble.  The file-preamble contains
   information on the file format version and an array of block-
   parameters items (the contents of which include collection and
   storage parameters used for one or more blocks).

   The file header is followed by a series of data blocks.

   A block consists of a block header, containing a preamble item,
   various tables of common data, and some statistics for the traffic
   received over the block.  The block header is then followed by a list
   of the Q/R data items detailing the queries and responses received
   during processing of the block input.  The list of Q/R data items is
   in turn followed by a list of per-client counts of particular IP
   events and a list of malformed messages that occurred during
   collection of the block data.

   The exact nature of the DNS data will affect what block size is the
   best fit, however sample data for a root server indicated that block
   sizes up to 10,000 Q/R data items give good results.  See
   Appendix C.6 for more details.

6.1.1.  Block parameters

   An array of block-parameters items is stored in the file header (with
   a minimum of one item at index 0) in order to support use cases such
   as wanting to merge C-DNS files from different sources.  The block
   header preamble item then contains an optional index for the block-
   parameters item that applies for that block; if not present the index
   defaults to 0.  Hence, in effect, a global block-parameters item is
   defined which can then be overridden per block.

6.2.  Storage parameters

   The block-parameters item includes a storage parameters item - this
   contains information about the specific data fields stored in the
   C-DNS file.

   These parameters include:

   o  The sub-second timing resolution used by the data.

   o  Information (hints) on which optional data items can be expected
      to appear in the data.  See Section 6.2.1.

   o  Recorded OPCODES and RR types.  See Section 6.2.2.

   o  Flags indicating whether the data is sampled or anonymised.  See
      #sampling-and-anonymisation).

   o  Client and server IPv4 and IPv6 address prefixes.  See
      Section 6.2.4

6.2.1.  Optional data items

   To enable applications to store data to their precise requirements in
   as space-efficient manner as possible, all fields in the following
   arrays are optional

   o  Query/Response

   o  Query Signature

   o  Malformed messages

   In other words, an application can choose to omit any data item that
   is not required for its use case.  In addition, implementations may
   be configured to not record all RRs, or only record messages with
   certain OPCODES.

   This does, however, mean that a consumer of a C-DNS file faces two
   problems:

   1.  How can it quickly determine whether a file contains the data
       items it requires to complete a particular task (e.g.
       reconstructing query traffic or performing a specific piece of
       data analysis)?

   2.  How can it determine if a data item is not present because it was
       a. explicitly not recorded or b. not present in the original data
       stream/the data item was not available to the collecting
       application

   For example, an application capturing C-DNS data from within a
   nameserver implementation is unlikely to be able to record the
   client-hoplimit.  Or, if there is no query ARCount recorded and no
   query OPT RDATA recorded, is that because no query contained an OPT
   RR, or because that data was not stored?

   The storage parameters hints therefore specify whether the writer of
   the file recorded each data item if it was present.  An application
   consuming that file can then use these to quickly determine whether
   the input data is rich enough for its needs.

   QUESTION: Should the items within certain arrays also be optional
   e.g. within the RR array should all of Name index, ClassType, TTL and
   RDATA be optional

6.2.2.  Optional RRs and OPCODES

   Also included in the storage parameters is an explicit list of the RR
   types and OPCODES that were recorded.  Using an explicit list removes
   any ambiguity about whether the OPCODE/RR type was not recognised by
   the collecting implementation or whether it was specifically
   configured not to record it.

   For the case of unrecognised OPCODES the message may be parsable (for
   example, if it has a format similar enough to the one described in
   [RFC1035]) or it may not.  Similarly for unrecognised RR types the
   RDATA can still be stored, but the collector will not be able to
   process it to remove, for example, name compression pointers.

   QUESTION: Should the storage parameters additionally define whether
   unrecognised OPCODES/RR types are stored ?

6.2.3.  Sampling and Anonymisation

   The format contains flags that can be used to indicate if the data is
   either anonymised or produced from sample data.

   QUESTION: Should fields be added to indicate the sampling/
   anonymisation method used and if so should text strings be used?

   QUESTION: Should there be another flag to indicate that names have
   been normalised (e.g. converted to uniform case)?

6.2.4.  IP Address storage

   If IP address prefixes are given, only the prefix bits of addresses
   are stored.  For example, if a client IPv4 prefix of 16 is specified,
   a client address of 192.0.2.1 will be stored as 0xc000 (192.0),
   reducing address storage space requirements.

7.  C-DNS format detailed description

   The CDDL definition for the C-DNS format is given in Appendix A.

7.1.  Map quantities and indexes

   All map keys are integers with values specified in the CDDL.  String
   keys would significantly bloat the file size.

   All key values specified are positive integers under 24, so their
   CBOR representation is a single byte.

   All maps have have additional implementation-specific entries.
   Negative integer map keys are reserved for these values.  Key values
   from -1 to -24 also have a single byte CBOR representation, so such
   implementation-specific extensions are not at any space efficiency
   disadvantage.

   An item described as an index is the index of the data item in the
   referenced table.  Indexes are 0-based.

7.2.  Tabular representation

   The following sections present the C-DNS specification in tabular
   format with a detailed description of each item.

   In all quantities that contain bit flags, bit 0 indicates the least
   significant bit.

   For the sake of brevity, the following conventions are used in the
   tables:

   o  The column O marks whether items in a map are optional.

      *  O - Optional.  The item may be omitted.

      *  M - Mandatory.  The item must be present.

   o  The column T gives the CBOR data type of the item.

      *  U - Unsigned integer

      *  I - Signed integer

      *  B - Byte string

      *  T - Text string

      *  M - Map

      *  A - Array

   In the case of maps and arrays, more information on the type of each
   value is given in the description.

   QUESTION: Currently we collect OPT RDATA as a blob as this is
   consistent with re-uses the generic mechanism for RDATA storage.
   Should we break individual EDNS(0) options out and store then
   individually in new Block table?  This would potentially allow us to
   exploit option commonality and also make anonymising ECS client
   subnet easier.

7.5.3.3.  Question table contents

   The query-size and response-size fields hold the DNS message size.
   For UDP this is the size of the UDP payload that contained the DNS
   message.  For TCP it is the size of the DNS message as specified in
   the two-byte message length header.  Trailing bytes with queries are
   routinely observed in traffic to authoritative servers and this value
   allows a calculation of how many trailing bytes were present.

7.6.1.  Response processing data contents

   The response processing data is information on the server processing
   that produced the response.  It is a CBOR map as follows.

8.  Malformed Messages

   In the context of generating a C-DNS file it is assumed that only
   those DNS messages which can be parsed to produce a well-formed DNS
   message are stored in the C-DNS format and that all other messages
   will be recorded (if at all) as malformed messages.

   Parsing a well-formed message means as a minimum:

   o  The packet has a well-formed 12 byte DNS Header

   o  The section counts are consistent with the section contents

   o  All of the resource records can be parsed

   In principle, packets that do not meet these criteria could be
   classified into two categories:

   o  Partially malformed: those packets which can be decoded
      sufficiently to extract

      *  a well-formed 12 byte DNS header (and therefore a DNS
         transaction ID)

      *  the first Question in the Question section if QDCOUNT is
         greater than 0

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      February 2018


   but suffer other issues while parsing.  This is the minimum
   information required to attempt Query/Response matching as described
   in Section 10.1.

   o  Completely malformed: those packets that cannot be decoded to this
      extent.

   An open question is whether there is value in attempting to process
   partially malformed messages in an analogous manner to well formed
   messages in terms of attempting to match them with the corresponding
   query or response.  This could be done by creating 'placeholder'
   records during Query/Response matching with just the information
   extracted as above.  If the packet were then matched the resulting
   C-DNS Q/R data item would include flags to indicate a malformed query
   or response or both record (in addition to capturing the wire format
   of the packet).

   An advantage of this would be that it would result in more meaningful
   statistics about matched packets because, for example, some partially
   malformed queries could be matched to responses.  However it would
   only apply to those queries where the first Question is well formed.
   It could also simplify the downstream analysis of C-DNS files and the
   reconstruction of packet streams from C-DNS.

   A disadvantage is that this adds complexity to the Query/Response
   matching and data representation, could potentially lead to false
   matches and some additional statistics would be required (e.g. counts
   for matched-partially-malformed, unmatched-partially-malformed,
   completely-malformed).

   QUESTION: There has been no feedback to date requesting further work
   on the processing partially malformed messages.  The editors are
   inclined not to include it in this version.  It could be the subject
   of a future extension.

9.  C-DNS to PCAP

   It is possible to re-construct PCAP files from the C-DNS format in a
   lossy fashion.  Some of the issues with reconstructing both the DNS
   payload and the full packet stream are outlined here.

   The reconstruction depends on whether or not all the optional
   sections of both the query and response were captured in the C-DNS
   file.  Clearly, if they were not all captured, the reconstruction
   will be imperfect.

   Even if all sections of the response were captured, one cannot
   reconstruct the DNS response payload exactly due to the fact that

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      February 2018


   some DNS names in the message on the wire may have been compressed.
   Section 9.1 discusses this is more detail.

   Some transport information is not captured in the C-DNS format.  For
   example, the following aspects of the original packet stream cannot
   be re-constructed from the C-DNS format:

   o  IP fragmentation

   o  TCP stream information:

      *  Multiple DNS messages may have been sent in a single TCP
         segment

      *  A DNS payload may have be split across multiple TCP segments

      *  Multiple DNS messages may have be sent on a single TCP session

   o  Malformed DNS messages if the wire format is not recorded

   o  Any Non-DNS messages that were in the original packet stream e.g.
      ICMP

   Simple assumptions can be made on the reconstruction: fragmented and
   DNS-over-TCP messages can be reconstructed into single packets and a
   single TCP session can be constructed for each TCP packet.

   Additionally, if malformed messages and Non-DNS packets are captured
   separately, they can be merged with packet captures reconstructed
   from C-DNS to produce a more complete packet stream.

9.1.  Name Compression

   All the names stored in the C-DNS format are full domain names; no
   DNS style name compression is used on the individual names within the
   format.  Therefore when reconstructing a packet, name compression
   must be used in order to reproduce the on the wire representation of
   the packet.

   [RFC1035] name compression works by substituting trailing sections of
   a name with a reference back to the occurrence of those sections
   earlier in the message.  Not all name server software uses the same
   algorithm when compressing domain names within the responses.  Some
   attempt maximum recompression at the expense of runtime resources,
   others use heuristics to balance compression and speed and others use
   different rules for what is a valid compression target.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      February 2018


   This means that responses to the same question from different name
   server software which match in terms of DNS payload content (header,
   counts, RRs with name compression removed) do not necessarily match
   byte-for-byte on the wire.

   Therefore, it is not possible to ensure that the DNS response payload
   is reconstructed byte-for-byte from C-DNS data.  However, it can at
   least, in principle, be reconstructed to have the correct payload
   length (since the original response length is captured) if there is
   enough knowledge of the commonly implemented name compression
   algorithms.  For example, a simplistic approach would be to try each
   algorithm in turn to see if it reproduces the original length,
   stopping at the first match.  This would not guarantee the correct
   algorithm has been used as it is possible to match the length whilst
   still not matching the on the wire bytes but, without further
   information added to the C-DNS data, this is the best that can be
   achieved.

   Appendix B presents an example of two different compression
   algorithms used by well-known name server software.

10.  Data Collection

   This section describes a non-normative proposed algorithm for the
   processing of a captured stream of DNS queries and responses and
   matching queries/responses where possible.

   For the purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that the input has
   been pre-processed such that:

   1.  All IP fragmentation reassembly, TCP stream reassembly, and so
       on, has already been performed

   2.  Each message is associated with transport metadata required to
       generate the Primary ID (see Section 10.2.1)

   3.  Each message has a well-formed DNS header of 12 bytes and (if
       present) the first Question in the Question section can be parsed
       to generate the Secondary ID (see below).  As noted earlier, this
       requirement can result in a malformed query being removed in the
       pre-processing stage, but the correctly formed response with
       RCODE of FORMERR being present.

   DNS messages are processed in the order they are delivered to the
   application.  It should be noted that packet capture libraries do not
   necessary provide packets in strict chronological order.

   TODO: Discuss the corner cases resulting from this in more detail.

   A Primary ID is constructed for each message.  It is composed of the
   following data:

   1.  Source IP Address

   2.  Destination IP Address

   3.  Source Port

   4.  Destination Port

   5.  Transport

   6.  DNS Message ID

10.2.2.  Secondary ID (optional)

   If present, the first Question in the Question section is used as a
   secondary ID for each message.  Note that there may be well formed
   DNS queries that have a QDCOUNT of 0, and some responses may have a
   QDCOUNT of 0 (for example, responses with RCODE=FORMERR or NOTIMP).
   In this case the secondary ID is not used in matching.

10.3.  Algorithm Parameters

   1.  Query timeout

   2.  Skew timeout

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      February 2018


10.4.  Algorithm Requirements

   The algorithm is designed to handle the following input data:

   1.  Multiple queries with the same Primary ID (but different
       Secondary ID) arriving before any responses for these queries are
       seen.

   2.  Multiple queries with the same Primary and Secondary ID arriving
       before any responses for these queries are seen.

   3.  Queries for which no later response can be found within the
       specified timeout.

   4.  Responses for which no previous query can be found within the
       specified timeout.

10.5.  Algorithm Limitations

   For cases 1 and 2 listed in the above requirements, it is not
   possible to unambiguously match queries with responses.  This
   algorithm chooses to match to the earliest query with the correct
   Primary and Secondary ID.

10.6.  Workspace

   A FIFO structure is used to hold the Q/R data items during
   processing.

10.7.  Output

   The output is a list of Q/R data items.  Both the Query and Response
   elements are optional in these items, therefore Q/R data items have
   one of three types of content:

   1.  A matched pair of query and response messages

   2.  A query message with no response

   3.  A response message with no query

   The timestamp of a list item is that of the query for cases 1 and 2
   and that of the response for case 3.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      February 2018


10.8.  Post Processing

   When ending capture, all remaining entries in the Q/R data item FIFO
   should be treated as timed out queries.

11.  Implementation guidance

   TODO: Topics in this section need further expansion.

11.1.  Optional data

   When reading data where items required for reader function are
   missing, readers may wish to provide configurable default values to
   be used in their output.

11.2.  Trailing data in TCP

   Clearify the impact of processing wire captures which includes
   trailing data in TCP.  What will appear trailing data, what will
   appear as malformed messages?

11.3.  Limiting collection of RDATA

   Implementations should consider providing a configurable maximum
   RDATA size for capture.  For example, to avoid memory issues when
   confronted with large XFR records.

12.  Implementation Status

   [Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section and reference to
   [RFC7942] prior to publication.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation

   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

12.1.  DNS-STATS Compactor

   ICANN/Sinodun IT have developed an open source implementation called
   DNS-STATS Compactor.  The Compactor is a suite of tools which can
   capture DNS traffic (from either a network interface or a PCAP file)
   and store it in the Compacted-DNS (C-DNS) file format.  PCAP files
   for the captured traffic can also be reconstructed.  See Compactor
   [7].

   This implementation:

   o  is mature but has only been deployed for testing in a single
      environment so is not yet classified as production ready.

   o  covers the whole of the specification described in the -03 draft
      with the exception of support for malformed messages (Section 8)
      and pico second time resolution.  (Note: this implementation does
      allow malformed messages to be dumped to a PCAP file).

   o  is released under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.

   o  has a users mailing list available, see dns-stats-users [8].

   There is also some discussion of issues encountered during
   development available at Compressing Pcap Files [9] and Packet
   Capture [10].

   This information was last updated on 29th of June 2017.

13.  IANA Considerations

   None

14.  Security Considerations

   Any control interface MUST perform authentication and encryption.

   Any data upload MUST be authenticated and encrypted.

15.  Acknowledgements

   many useful discussions on binary formats, compression and packet
   matching.  Also Jan Vcelak and Wouter Wijngaards for discussions on

Appendix B.  DNS Name compression example

   The basic algorithm, which follows the guidance in [RFC1035], is
   simply to collect each name, and the offset in the packet at which it
   starts, during packet construction.  As each name is added, it is
   offered to each of the collected names in order of collection,
   starting from the first name.  If labels at the end of the name can
   be replaced with a reference back to part (or all) of the earlier
   name, and if the uncompressed part of the name is shorter than any
   compression already found, the earlier name is noted as the
   compression target for the name.

   The following tables illustrate the process.  In an example packet,
   the first name is example.com.

          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | N | Name        | Uncompressed | Compression Target |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | 1 | example.com |              |                    |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+

   The next name added is bar.com.  This is matched against example.com.
   The com part of this can be used as a compression target, with the
   remaining uncompressed part of the name being bar.

          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | N | Name        | Uncompressed | Compression Target |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | 1 | example.com |              |                    |
          | 2 | bar.com     | bar          | 1 + offset to com  |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+

   The third name added is www.bar.com.  This is first matched against
   example.com, and as before this is recorded as a compression target,
   with the remaining uncompressed part of the name being www.bar.  It
   is then matched against the second name, which again can be a
   compression target.  Because the remaining uncompressed part of the
   name is www, this is an improved compression, and so it is adopted.

          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | N | Name        | Uncompressed | Compression Target |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | 1 | example.com |              |                    |
          | 2 | bar.com     | bar          | 1 + offset to com  |
          | 3 | www.bar.com | www          | 2                  |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+

   As an optimization, if a name is already perfectly compressed (in
   other words, the uncompressed part of the name is empty), then no
   further names will be considered for compression.

B.1.  NSD compression algorithm

   Using the above basic algorithm the packet lengths of responses
   generated by NSD [12] can be matched almost exactly.  At the time of
   writing, a tiny number (<.01%) of the reconstructed packets had
   incorrect lengths.

B.2.  Knot Authoritative compression algorithm

   The Knot Authoritative [13] name server uses different compression
   behavior, which is the result of internal optimization designed to
   balance runtime speed with compression size gains.  In brief, and
   omitting complications, Knot Authoritative will only consider the
   QNAME and names in the immediately preceding RR section in an RRSET
   as compression targets.

   A set of smart heuristics as described below can be implemented to
   mimic this and while not perfect it produces output nearly, but not
   quite, as good a match as with NSD.  The heuristics are:

   1.  A match is only perfect if the name is completely compressed AND
       the TYPE of the section in which the name occurs matches the TYPE
       of the name used as the compression target.

   2.  If the name occurs in RDATA:

       *  If the compression target name is in a query, then only the
          first RR in an RRSET can use that name as a compression
          target.

       *  The compression target name MUST be in RDATA.

       *  The name section TYPE must match the compression target name
          section TYPE.

       *  The compression target name MUST be in the immediately
          preceding RR in the RRSET.

   Using this algorithm less than 0.1% of the reconstructed packets had
   incorrect lengths.

B.3.  Observed differences

   In sample traffic collected on a root name server around 2-4% of
   responses generated by Knot had different packet lengths to those
   produced by NSD.

Appendix C.  Comparison of Binary Formats

   Several binary serialisation formats were considered, and for
   completeness were also compared to JSON.

   o  Apache Avro [14].  Data is stored according to a pre-defined
      schema.  The schema itself is always included in the data file.
      Data can therefore be stored untagged, for a smaller serialisation
      size, and be written and read by an Avro library.

      *  At the time of writing, Avro libraries are available for C,
         C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby and PHP.  Optionally tools are
         available for C++, Java and C# to generate code for encoding
         and decoding.

   o  Google Protocol Buffers [15].  Data is stored according to a pre-
      defined schema.  The schema is used by a generator to generate
      code for encoding and decoding the data.  Data can therefore be
      stored untagged, for a smaller serialisation size.  The schema is
      not stored with the data, so unlike Avro cannot be read with a
      generic library.

      *  Code must be generated for a particular data schema to to read
         and write data using that schema.  At the time of writing, the
         Google code generator can currently generate code for encoding
         and decoding a schema for C++, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, C#,
         Objective-C, Javascript and PHP.

   o  CBOR [16].  Defined in [RFC7049], this serialisation format is
      comparable to JSON but with a binary representation.  It does not
      use a pre-defined schema, so data is always stored tagged.
      However, CBOR data schemas can be described using CDDL
      [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl] and tools exist to verify data files conform
      to the schema.

      *  CBOR is a simple format, and simple to implement.  At the time
         of writing, the CBOR website lists implementations for 16
         languages.

   Avro and Protocol Buffers both allow storage of untagged data, but
   because they rely on the data schema for this, their implementation
   is considerably more complex than CBOR.  Using Avro or Protocol

   Buffers in an unsupported environment would require notably greater
   development effort compared to CBOR.

   A test program was written which reads input from a PCAP file and
   writes output using one of two basic structures; either a simple
   structure, where each query/response pair is represented in a single
   record entry, or the C-DNS block structure.

   The resulting output files were then compressed using a variety of
   common general-purpose lossless compression tools to explore the
   compressibility of the formats.  The compression tools employed were:

   o  snzip [17].  A command line compression tool based on the Google
      Snappy [18] library.

   o  lz4 [19].  The command line compression tool from the reference C
      LZ4 implementation.

   o  gzip [20].  The ubiquitous GNU zip tool.

   o  zstd [21].  Compression using the Zstandard algorithm.

   o  xz [22].  A popular compression tool noted for high compression.

   In all cases the compression tools were run using their default
   settings.

   Note that this draft does not mandate the use of compression, nor any
   particular compression scheme, but it anticipates that in practice
   output data will be subject to general-purpose compression, and so
   this should be taken into consideration.

   "test.pcap", a 662Mb capture of sample data from a root instance was
   used for the comparison.  The following table shows the formatted
   size and size after compression (abbreviated to Comp. in the table
   headers), together with the task resident set size (RSS) and the user
   time taken by the compression.  File sizes are in Mb, RSS in kb and
   user time in seconds.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      February 2018


   The above results are discussed in the following sections.

C.1.  Comparison with full PCAP files

   An important first consideration is whether moving away from PCAP
   offers significant benefits.

   The simple binary formats are typically larger than PCAP, even though
   they omit some information such as Ethernet MAC addresses.  But not
   only do they require less CPU to compress than PCAP, the resulting
   compressed files are smaller than compressed PCAP.

C.2.  Simple versus block coding

   The intention of the block coding is to perform data de-duplication
   on query/response records within the block.  The simple and block
   formats above store exactly the same information for each query/
   response record.  This information is parsed from the DNS traffic in
   the input PCAP file, and in all cases each field has an identifier
   and the field data is typed.

   The data de-duplication on the block formats show an order of
   magnitude reduction in the size of the format file size against the
   simple formats.  As would be expected, the compression tools are able
   to find and exploit a lot of this duplication, but as the de-
   duplication process uses knowledge of DNS traffic, it is able to
   retain a size advantage.  This advantage reduces as stronger
   compression is applied, as again would be expected, but even with the
   strongest compression applied the block formatted data remains around
   75% of the size of the simple format and its compression requires
   roughly a third of the CPU time.

C.3.  Binary versus text formats

   Text data formats offer many advantages over binary formats,
   particularly in the areas of ad-hoc data inspection and extraction.
   It was therefore felt worthwhile to carry out a direct comparison,
   implementing JSON versions of the simple and block formats.

   Concentrating on JSON block format, the format files produced are a
   significant fraction of an order of magnitude larger than binary
   formats.  The impact on file size after compression is as might be
   expected from that starting point; the stronger compression produces
   files that are 150% of the size of similarly compressed binary
   format, and require over 4x more CPU to compress.

C.4.  Performance

   Concentrating again on the block formats, all three produce format
   files that are close to an order of magnitude smaller that the
   original "test.pcap" file.  CBOR produces the largest files and Avro
   the smallest, 20% smaller than CBOR.

   However, once compression is taken into account, the size difference
   narrows.  At medium compression (with gzip), the size difference is
   4%.  Using strong compression (with xz) the difference reduces to 2%,
   with Avro the largest and Protocol Buffers the smallest, although
   CBOR and Protocol Buffers require slightly more compression CPU.

   The measurements presented above do not include data on the CPU
   required to generate the format files.  Measurements indicate that
   writing Avro requires 10% more CPU than CBOR or Protocol Buffers.  It
   appears, therefore, that Avro's advantage in compression CPU usage is
   probably offset by a larger CPU requirement in writing Avro.

C.5.  Conclusions

   The above assessments lead us to the choice of a binary format file
   using blocking.

   As noted previously, this draft anticipates that output data will be
   subject to compression.  There is no compelling case for one
   particular binary serialisation format in terms of either final file
   size or machine resources consumed, so the choice must be largely
   based on other factors.  CBOR was therefore chosen as the binary
   serialisation format for the reasons listed in Section 5.

C.6.  Block size choice

   Given the choice of a CBOR format using blocking, the question arises
   of what an appropriate default value for the maximum number of query/
   response pairs in a block should be.  This has two components; what
   is the impact on performance of using different block sizes in the
   format file, and what is the impact on the size of the format file
   before and after compression.

   The following table addresses the performance question, showing the
   impact on the performance of a C++ program converting "test.pcap" to
   C-DNS.  File size is in Mb, resident set size (RSS) in kb.

              |     160000 |     55.94 | 733.84 |     14.44 |
              |     320000 |     54.41 | 799.20 |     13.97 |
              +------------+-----------+--------+-----------+

   Increasing block size, therefore, tends to increase maximum RSS a
   little, with no significant effect (if anything a small reduction) on
   CPU consumption.

   The following figure plots the effect of increasing block size on
   output file size for different compressions.

   Figure showing effect of block size on file size (PNG) [23]

   Figure showing effect of block size on file size (SVG) [24]

   From the above, there is obviously scope for tuning the default block
   size to the compression being employed, traffic characteristics,
   frequency of output file rollover etc.  Using a strong compression,
   block sizes over 10,000 query/response pairs would seem to offer
   limited improvements.
